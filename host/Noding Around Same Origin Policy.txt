This is an example of using Node.js to get around the same origin policy of web browsers. We need to post our poker hand to a web service to get back the best hand we have. The Same Origin Policy prevents us from posting data to another site. We create a Node.js server to serve our own PokerAPI page that simply posts back to our server that sends the request to the real PokerAPI website. That's it. Only browsers are subject to the same origin policy.
