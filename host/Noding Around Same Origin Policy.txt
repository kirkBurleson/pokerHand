This is an example of using Node.js to get around the same origin policy of
web browsers. We need to post our poker hand to a web service to get back the
best hand we have. The Same Origin Policy prevents us from posting data to 
another site. So we create a Node.js server to serve our own PokerAPI page 
that simply posts back to our server that sends the request to the real 
pokerAPI website. That's it. Only browsers are subject to the same origin 
policy.

Run the Host and Consumer servers on two different computers.
